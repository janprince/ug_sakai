### Sakai
Sakai is a free, open-source educational software platform for teaching, 
research, and collaboration. This type of system is also known as a course management system (CMS), a learning management system (LMS), 
or a virtual learning environment (VLE).

Hundreds of institutions use Sakai, primarily in the United 
States, but also in Canada, Europe, Asia, **Africa**, and Australia. 
Sakai was created with scalability, dependability, interoperability, 
and extensibility in mind. Its largest installations support more 
than 100,000 users.

This project focuses on scraping data from the University of Ghana's clone of Sakai.
